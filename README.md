# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets directed at various US airlines. The sentiment analysis is performed using different machine learning models to classify the sentiment of tweets as positive, neutral, or negative. The project uses Python, with extensive data preprocessing, visualization, and model-building techniques to explore the effectiveness of various classification algorithms.

Key Components:

Data Preparation:
The dataset, which contains tweets about US airlines, is loaded and inspected for quality and completeness.
Text preprocessing steps are applied, including removal of special characters, tokenization, removal of stop words, and normalization, to prepare the data for machine learning models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize sentiment distribution, word frequencies, and other key data characteristics.

Model Development:
Several machine learning models are implemented, including Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, to classify tweet sentiment.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Visualization and Analysis:

Visualizations such as word clouds, sentiment distribution plots, and confusion matrices are generated using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
The analysis focuses on identifying common words in positive and negative sentiments, understanding the overall sentiment towards airlines, and comparing the performance of different classifiers.

Libraries and Tools Used:
Python: For the overall implementation of the project.
NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For natural language processing, including tokenization, stop word removal, and word cloud generation.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
MLxtend: For advanced plotting functions like confusion matrices.

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis on social media data. By comparing different classifiers, it identifies the most effective model for sentiment classification in the context of airline customer feedback.
